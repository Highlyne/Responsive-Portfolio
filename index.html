      <p>Being of service to others is what brings true happines. -Marie Osmond</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am a graduate of University of Central Florida. Though Florida has always been my home at heart, for several years
        I lived outside of the continental U.S. I capitalized this opportunity by spending a lot of time traveling. While
        living in Germany, a worked as a Jr. Project Manager for the D.O.D. Housing Office.</p>

      <p>Germany, my family moved to Anchorage, Alaska. There I leveraged my superior customer service skills to clam and assist
        frustrated clients on behalf of Chugach Electric Association. Here in Orlando, FL I utilized my B.A. degree in Business
        Administration, 3.3 G.P.A., while working as a Quality Administrator for Ravago Americas. During this time I created
        a training program for a newly implemented task management system that remains in use today.</p>

      <p>Recently, I completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp program designed by Trilogy Education Services and backed
        by UCF. Now I am enjoying a rewarding role as a Teaching Assitant with that very same program. I am excited to share
        what I've learned with other eager students.
