# Responsive-Portfolio

## Overview

Basic Portfolio site made mobile responsive by flexing the powers of media queires. 

The CSS Syle sheet uses three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.

Max-width 980px is choosen to ensure none of the content is cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, the media queries will kick in before the content gets cut off.

768px is about the width of a tablet and 640px is about the width of a phone in landscape.

Meta viewport tag has been included in all HTML files for the media queires to function.
