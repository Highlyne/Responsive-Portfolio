# Responsive-Portfolio

## Overview

Basic Portfolio site made mobile responsive by flexing the powers of media queires. 

The CSS Syle sheet uses three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.

Since a desktop layout is about 960px wide, a media querie with max-width of 980px is choosen to ensure none of the content. 

768px is about the width of a tablet and 640px is about the width of a phone in landscape.

Meta viewport tag has been included in all HTML files for the media queires to function.
